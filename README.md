**mproved approximation algorithm for Maximin share (MMS) allocations
**Our aim for this project was to find conjectures on how to improve the approximation guarantee of MMS algorithms, verify or falsify these conjectures by implementing them on randomly generated problem instances, and try to mathematically prove verified conjectures. We started with studying the basics of Fair division of discrete items and various notions of fair discrete item allocation. We then learnt and implemented an EF1 (envy-free up to one item) algorithm, which involved analyzing the envy-freeness of agents to determine which agent gets the next unallocated item. Followed by this, we then learnt two MMS algorithms, one for finding a ½-MMS allocation, and one for a ⅔-MMS allocation. For understanding the ⅔-MMS algorithm, we applied the concepts of direct acyclic graphs (DAGs), and learnt how to formally prove an algorithm is correct. Specifically, my progress was implementing an EF1 algorithm, a ½-MMS algorithm, and code to create random data sets for testing future conjectures for improved algorithms. Some topics I learned about this semester included fundamental graph theory, proof writing, notions of fair division, how to implement various algorithms, and how to read research papers and mathematical notation. In the future, we hope to study the ¾-MMS algorithm and its limitations and find successful conjectures to improve to a ⅘-MMS allocation.
